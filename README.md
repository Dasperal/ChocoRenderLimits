# ChocoRenderLimits

 * Repository: https://github.com/chocolatiers/ChocoRenderLimits

ChocoRenderLimits aims to help map developers test their maps within the
limitations of Vanilla Doom. It provides visual cues for players to find and
potentially locate visplane overflows and other renderer issues.

It was formerly maintained by RestlessRodent, but they no longer do active
development.

# Controls
