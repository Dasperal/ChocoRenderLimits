# ChocoRenderLimits

ChocoRenderLimits aims to help map developers test their maps within the
limitations of Vanilla Doom. It provides visual cues for players to find and
potentially locate visplane overflows and other renderer issues.

It was formerly maintained by RestlessRodent, but she no longer does active
development.

This is a SDL2 version with very few additional tweaks and corrections, primary 
for Windows operating system. Maintained by [Julian Nechaevsky](http://jnechaevsky.users.sourceforge.net/author.html).
