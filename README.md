# ChocoRenderLimits

 * Repository: https://github.com/chocolatiers/ChocoRenderLimits

ChocoRenderLimits aims to help map developers test their maps within the
limitations of Vanilla Doom. It provides visual cues for players to find and
potentially locate visplane overflows and other renderer issues.

It was formerly maintained by RestlessRodent, but she no longer does active
development.

# Controls

The _grave_/_tilde_ key opens the menu which can be used to change the
settings.
