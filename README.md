CRL is a continuation of [Chocorenderlimits](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Chocorenderlimits) source port, created by [RestlessRodent](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/RestlessRodent). 

Armed with new features, QoL and technical improvements, it provides the ability to assist mappers in creation of Vanilla comaptible maps, as well as checking some specific scenarios via additional ingame modes.

CRL is maintained by [Julia Nechaevskaya](mailto:julia.nechaevskaya@live.com).
