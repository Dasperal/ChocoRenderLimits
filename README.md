## CRL

[![CRL icon](https://github.com/JNechaevsky/ChocoRenderLimits/blob/master/data/doom.png)](https://github.com/JNechaevsky/ChocoRenderLimits)

CRL is a continuation of [Chocorenderlimits](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Chocorenderlimits) source port, created by [RestlessRodent](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/RestlessRodent). 

Armed with new features, QoL and technical improvements, it provides the ability to assist mappers in creation of Vanilla comaptible maps, as well as checking some specific scenarios via additional ingame modes. The _tilde_ [<kbd>~</kbd>] key opens the in-game menu which can be used to change the settings and features.

CRL is maintained by [Julia Nechaevskaya](mailto:julia.nechaevskaya@live.com).

### Download:

CRL is currently under development.

Old version of Chocorenderlimits ported to SDL2 can be found [here](https://github.com/JNechaevsky/ChocoRenderLimits/releases/tag/1.0).

* **ANI:** Number of lines with scrolling animations (line effect â„–48).
