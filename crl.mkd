# Chocorenderlimits 2.0

**Chocorenderlimits** now uses a menu based system in game rather than hotkeys.

This menu is accessed with the _grave_/_tilde_ key (the key you use to open and
close the console on most source ports and **Quake**).

# Brute Force

Brute force mode can be used by specifying `-brute (n)`, where _n_ is the
granularity.
